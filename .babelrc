/*
Order:
Plugins run before Presets.
Plugin ordering is first to last.
Preset ordering is reversed (last to first).

React preset => includes flow preset which includes transform-flow-strip-types(removes flow types)

We can use the env option to set specific options when in a certain environment. Options specific to a certain environment are merged into and overwrite non-env specific options. Presets do not merge if you define presets in an env.
Using modules:false means that es6 import will not be converted to Common.js. That means that if inside webpack.config we want to use import and export we need to remove modules:false from here and set it inside webpack.config
